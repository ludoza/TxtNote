#TxtNote

## Introduction

A Chrome plugin that stores all your text notes as you enter them in the browser.

## Features

 - Auto save
 - Markdown support with preview

## History

I created the plugin last year somewhere for my own use and recently added markdown support because I got tired of copying my text between TxtNote and [showdown.im](http://showdown.im/).

I personally use TxtNote on a daily basis, but I'm not happy with the source and a cleanup will happen in the near future.

## Planned Features

 - Cleanup of source code
 - Time logging of each key stroke/action
 - Integration with Dropbox and Ubuntu One

## Contributions

Here be dragons, as mentioned this web application is useful but it is a hack and a cleanup is needed.

But you are welcome to fork it and fix all the bugs as you find them.
